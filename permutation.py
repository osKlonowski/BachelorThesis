# Compute a matrix of meetings and a vector of waiting tables:

# Start from a copy of the “previous meetings matrix”,
# use the schedule file for the respective number of pairs (and rounds)
# such that for all meetings that happen in the new tournament
# the number of meetings among two pairs will be incremented by 4.
# (two players each meeting two other players)

# Start with a copy of the vector of “previous waiting tables”.
# For each pair having a waiting table increment their value by 2.
# (both players have a waiting table)

# Example -- Basic Schedule File
# number of pairs    number of tables    number of rounds    number of board groups    Individual=0
# Examle -- for a single Section
# 16 - 8 - 12 - 12 - 0
# (Not sure about the 12)
